# Task Module
You have entered the task-based work module. The task list file for this project is `\.project-management\tasks\current-tasks.md`.  It will contain the current status of tasks in this format:
- [x] 1.0 Parent Task Title
  - [x] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Task Title

Your work at this time is the next avaiable (uncompleted) task in the list.  For the example above that would be task 1.2.

Follow the remaining guidelines below to manage this file.

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task** process only one task.
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed. 

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep “Relevant Files” accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file
