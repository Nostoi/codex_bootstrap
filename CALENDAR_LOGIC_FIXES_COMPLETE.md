# Calendar Integration Logic Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Summary

Fixed 2 remaining logic test failures in calendar integration tests:

1. "should handle all-day events" - incorrect energy level inference
2. "should reject malformed events" - weak validation logic

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: All-Day Event Energy Classification

**Problem**: All-day events were being classified as HIGH energy instead of LOW energy
**Root Cause**: The logic `attendeeCount === 0` was triggering HIGH energy for all-day events since they typically have no attendees field

### Issue 2: Malformed Event Validation

**Problem**: Invalid dateTime strings like "invalid-date" were not being caught
**Root Cause**: Date validation was only checking for missing dateTime but not for Invalid Date objects

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Energy Level Inference (inferEnergyLevel method)

```typescript
// Check for all-day events first (LOW energy)
if (event.start?.date || event.end?.date) {
  return EnergyLevel.LOW;
}

// Rest of the logic...
if (attendeeCount === 0) {
  return EnergyLevel.HIGH; // Focus time/deep work
}
```

### Fix 2: Date Validation (parseCalendarEventToTimeSlot method)

```typescript
// Enhanced validation for dateTime strings
const startDate = new Date(event.start.dateTime);
const endDate = new Date(event.end.dateTime);

if (isNaN(startDate.getTime()) || isNaN(endDate.getTime())) {
  throw new Error(`Invalid event dates: ${event.start.dateTime} - ${event.end.dateTime}`);
}
```

## Test Results

### Before Fixes

```
FAIL  calendar-integration.test.ts
  ✕ should handle all-day events
  ✕ should reject malformed events
```

### After Fixes

```
PASS  calendar-integration.test.ts (12.963s)
  ✓ All 22 tests passing
```

## Energy Level Inference Rules (Documented)

1. **ALL-DAY EVENTS** → LOW energy (vacation, holidays, PTO)
2. **FOCUS/DEEP WORK** (0 attendees) → HIGH energy
3. **LARGE MEETINGS** (5+ attendees) → LOW energy
4. **SMALL MEETINGS** (1-4 attendees) → MEDIUM energy
5. **SOCIAL/INFORMAL** keywords → Context-based inference

## Focus Type Inference Rules

1. **Technical**: code, review, development, programming
2. **Creative**: brainstorming, design, workshop, creative
3. **Administrative**: admin, expense, reports, paperwork
4. **Social**: Default for meetings with attendees

## Quality Assurance

- ✅ All 22 calendar integration tests pass
- ✅ Daily planner service tests remain stable (26 tests pass)
- ✅ No regressions in other test suites
- ✅ ADHD-optimized energy classification preserved
- ✅ Robust validation for malformed calendar data

## Files Modified

1. `backend/src/planning/daily-planner.service.ts`
   - Enhanced `inferEnergyLevel()` method
   - Improved `parseCalendarEventToTimeSlot()` validation

## Impact

This completes the calendar integration logic layer, ensuring:

- Accurate energy level classification for ADHD-optimized scheduling
- Robust handling of real-world calendar data variations
- Better error handling for malformed events
- Reliable all-day event processing

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
**Date**: January 4, 2025
**Tests Passing**: 48/48 calendar and daily planner tests
