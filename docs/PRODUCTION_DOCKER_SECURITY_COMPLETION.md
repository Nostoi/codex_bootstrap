- `scripts/deploy-production.sh` - Secure deployment automation
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` - GitHub Actions security workflow

### Documentation
- `docs/CONTAINER_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` - Complete security implementation guide
- `backend/.env.production.example` - Production environment template

### Enhanced Existing Files
- `scripts/security-scan.sh` - Improved secret detection and reporting
- `security-config.yml` - Already existed with good security policies

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Frameworks Addressed
- ✅ **CIS Docker Benchmark** - Container security best practices
- ✅ **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Risk management approach  
- ✅ **SOC 2 Type II** - Security controls for service organizations

### Security Controls Implemented
- **Preventive**: Container hardening, network isolation, access controls
- **Detective**: Vulnerability scanning, runtime monitoring, log analysis
- **Responsive**: Automated alerts, incident procedures, security gates

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Configure production environment
cp backend/.env.production.example backend/.env.production
# Edit with actual production values

# 2. Set up database secrets
echo "your_db_password" > secrets/db_password.txt
chmod 600 secrets/db_password.txt

# 3. Run security validation
./scripts/production-security-gate.sh

# 4. Deploy securely
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

### Monitoring and Maintenance
```bash
# Check security status
./scripts/security-scan.sh

# View security events
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-secure.yml logs falco

# Monitor deployment
./scripts/deploy-production.sh status
```
