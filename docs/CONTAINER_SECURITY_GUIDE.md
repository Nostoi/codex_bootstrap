# Container Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security implementation for Codex Bootstrap's production Docker containers. The security strategy follows industry best practices and implements defense-in-depth principles.

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Approach

1. **Container Image Security**
   - Multi-stage builds to minimize attack surface
   - Non-root user execution
   - Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
   - Security labels and metadata

2. **Runtime Security**
   - Container isolation with restricted capabilities
   - Resource limits and constraints
   - Network segmentation
   - Read-only root filesystems (where applicable)

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Secure container orchestration
   - Encrypted communication
   - Secrets management
   - Security monitoring and alerting

## Security Controls Implemented

### Container Hardening

#### Backend Container (`codex-backend`)

- **Base Image**: `node:20-alpine` (minimal attack surface)
- **User**: Non-root user `nestjs` (UID: 1001)
- **Capabilities**: Dropped ALL, added only necessary ones (CHOWN, SETGID, SETUID)
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring
- **Security Labels**: Enabled for tracking and compliance

#### Frontend Container (`codex-frontend`)

- **Base Image**: `node:20-alpine`
- **User**: Non-root user `nextjs` (UID: 1001)
- **Capabilities**: Dropped ALL
- **Optimizations**: Multi-stage build with standalone output

#### Database Container (`db`)

- **Base Image**: `postgres:15-alpine`
- **User**: Non-root postgres user (UID: 999)
- **Secrets**: External secrets management
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted at rest and in transit

### Network Security

#### Network Segmentation

```yaml
# Three isolated networks:
- secure_backend: Backend services communication
- secure_frontend: Frontend and proxy communication
- monitoring: Security monitoring traffic
```

#### Nginx Security Proxy

- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DoS attacks
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP implementation
- **TLS Configuration**: Modern TLS 1.2/1.3 with secure ciphers

### Secrets Management

#### Docker Secrets

- Database credentials stored as Docker secrets
- File-based secrets with proper permissions (600)
- Runtime secret injection (no secrets in images)

#### Environment Variables

- No sensitive data in environment variables
- Secure configuration file mounting
- Development vs production separation

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Falco Runtime Security

- Real-time threat detection
- Container runtime monitoring
- Custom rules for application-specific threats
- Integration with security incident response

#### Security Scanning

- **Trivy**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- **Multi-scan types**: Vulnerabilities, secrets, misconfigurations
- **Threshold enforcement**: Zero critical vulnerabilities in production
- **Automated reports**: JSON and markdown reporting

## Security Policies

### Production Security Gates

Before any production deployment, containers must pass:

1. **Vulnerability Scan**
   - ✅ 0 CRITICAL vulnerabilities
   - ✅ ≤2 HIGH vulnerabilities
   - ✅ 0 exposed secrets

2. **Configuration Security**
   - ✅ Non-root user execution
   - ✅ Security labels present
   - ✅ Health checks configured

3. **Network Security**
   - ✅ Network isolation implemented
   - ✅ Secure communication protocols
   - ✅ Rate limiting configured

4. **Secrets Management**
   - ✅ External secrets management
   - ✅ No secrets in version control
   - ✅ Proper file permissions

### Compliance Framework

Our security implementation addresses:

- **CIS Docker Benchmark**: Container security best practices
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management approach
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls for service organizations

## Implementation Commands

### Deploy Secure Production Environment

```bash
# 1. Run security gate validation
./scripts/production-security-gate.sh

# 2. Deploy with secure configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production-secure.yml up -d

# 3. Verify security monitoring
docker-compose logs falco

# 4. Check container security status
./scripts/security-scan.sh
```

### Security Maintenance

```bash
# Daily vulnerability scanning
./scripts/production-security-gate.sh quick

# Weekly comprehensive security review
./scripts/production-security-gate.sh production

# Monitor security events
tail -f /var/log/falco/events.log
```

## Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics

1. **Container Security**
   - Non-root execution: 100%
   - Critical vulnerabilities: 0
   - Security labels compliance: 100%

2. **Network Security**
   - Failed connection attempts
   - Unusual network patterns
   - Rate limiting effectiveness

3. **Runtime Security**
   - Privilege escalation attempts
   - Suspicious command execution
   - File system changes

### Alerting Thresholds

- **CRITICAL**: Privilege escalation, exposed secrets
- **HIGH**: Multiple failed authentications, unusual network activity
- **MEDIUM**: Configuration drift, policy violations
- **LOW**: Resource limit warnings, performance issues

## Incident Response

### Security Event Categories

1. **Container Compromise**
   - Immediate container isolation
   - Forensic image capture
   - Incident analysis and response

2. **Network Security Breach**
   - Network traffic analysis
   - Access log review
   - Connection blocking and mitigation

3. **Data Security Incident**
   - Data access audit
   - Encryption verification
   - Compliance notification procedures

### Response Procedures

1. **Detection**: Falco alerts, monitoring systems
2. **Analysis**: Log correlation, impact assessment
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected containers
4. **Eradication**: Remove threats, patch vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore services, verify integrity
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update security controls

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Container security tests
./scripts/security-scan.sh

# Production security gate
./scripts/production-security-gate.sh

# Network security validation
docker-compose exec nginx nginx -t
```

### Manual Security Reviews

1. **Monthly**: Security configuration review
2. **Quarterly**: Penetration testing
3. **Annually**: Comprehensive security audit

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Tasks

3. **Security Tools**: Keep scanning tools and configurations current
4. **Documentation**: Maintain current security procedures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Container Won't Start**
   - Check user permissions and capabilities
   - Verify secrets are properly mounted
   - Review security policy restrictions

2. **Network Connectivity Issues**
   - Verify network isolation rules
   - Check security group configurations
   - Review proxy and firewall settings

3. **Security Scan Failures**
