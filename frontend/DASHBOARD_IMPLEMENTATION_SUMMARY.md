4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint management
5. **Accessibility First**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML

### TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  status: "todo" | "in-progress" | "done";
  dueDate?: string;
  priority: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  estimatedMinutes?: number;
  aiSuggestion?: string;
  project?: string;
}

interface ChatMessage {
