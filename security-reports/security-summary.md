### Medium Priority

- Configure security labels for better tracking
- Implement image signing for production
- Enable read-only root filesystem where possible

### Low Priority

- Regular vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Implement runtime security monitoring
- Consider using distroless images for smaller attack surface

## Detailed Reports

Individual vulnerability reports are available in:

- `security-reports/codex-backend_security-scan-scan.json`
- `security-reports/codex-frontend_security-scan-scan.json`

## Next Steps

1. Review and address all CRITICAL and HIGH vulnerabilities
