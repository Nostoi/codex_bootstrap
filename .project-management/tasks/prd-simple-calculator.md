# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Simple Calculator Demo

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a simple calculator demo application. The goal is to create a minimal, low-effort calculator app as a demonstration, following the base app setup of the repository. The calculator will allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## 2. Goals
- Provide a working demo of a basic calculator app.
- Allow users to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Keep implementation and design as simple as possible.

## 3. User Stories
- As a user, I want to enter two numbers and select an operation so that I can see the result.
- As a user, I want to clear the input and result so that I can perform a new calculation.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must allow users to input two numbers.
2. The system must allow users to select an operation: add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
3. The system must display the result of the calculation.
4. The system must provide a way to clear/reset the calculator.
5. The system must handle division by zero gracefully (e.g., show an error message).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- No support for advanced operations (e.g., exponents, square roots, parentheses).
- No calculation history or memory functions.
- No persistent storage or user authentication.
- No mobile/responsive design requirements.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)
- A minimal web interface (single page, basic layout) is sufficient.
- Use existing frontend stack (e.g., React) if present in the repo.
- No need for custom styling; default styles are acceptable.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)
- Place the app in the `frontend/` directory.
- Integrate with the existing frontend setup (e.g., React, if used).
- No backend integration required.

## 8. Success Metrics
- The calculator performs basic operations correctly.
- The app runs without errors and is easy to use.
- The demo can be shown as a working example with minimal effort.

## 9. Open Questions
- None at this time.
