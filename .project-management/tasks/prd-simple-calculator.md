# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Simple Calculator Demo

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a simple calculator demo application. The primary goal is to demonstrate the base app setup in this repository with minimal effort and features. The calculator will allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## 2. Goals
- Demonstrate the base app setup with a working frontend and backend.
- Provide a simple, interactive calculator for basic arithmetic.
- Ensure the app is easy to understand and maintain for junior developers.

## 3. User Stories
- As a user, I want to enter two numbers and select an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) so that I can see the result.
- As a user, I want to see an error message if I try to divide by zero.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must allow users to input two numbers.
2. The system must allow users to select an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
3. The system must display the result of the calculation after the user submits their input.
4. The system must display an error message if the user attempts to divide by zero.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- No scientific functions (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
- No calculation history or memory features.
- No persistent storage of calculations or user data.
- No custom design or advanced UI features beyond the base app setup.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)
- Use the default/base styles and components provided by the repository.
- UI should be clean and minimal, suitable for a demo.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)
- Should use the existing frontend and backend structure from the base app setup.
- No external dependencies beyond those already present in the base app.

## 8. Success Metrics
- The calculator performs all four basic operations correctly.
- Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message.
- The app runs without errors and is easy to understand for junior developers.

## 9. Open Questions
- None at this time.
