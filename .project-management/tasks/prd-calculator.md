## 1. Introduction/Overview
This project is a simple calculator web application, intended as a demonstration of the base app setup in this repository. The calculator will allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) between two numbers. The goal is to provide a minimal, working example for reference or onboarding.

## 2. Goals
- Allow users to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation.
- Display the result of the calculation immediately.
- Keep the UI and logic as simple as possible for demo purposes.

## 3. User Stories
- As a user, I want to enter two numbers and select an operation so that I can see the result.
- As a user, I want the calculator to handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-numeric values, division by zero).

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must allow users to input two numbers.
2. The system must allow users to select one of four operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
3. The system must display the result of the calculation after the user submits their input.
4. The system must handle division by zero by displaying an appropriate error message.
5. The system must validate that both inputs are numbers and display an error if not.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- No support for advanced operations (e.g., exponents, square roots, memory, history).
- No persistent data storage or user accounts.
- No mobile/responsive design requirements.
- No internationalization or accessibility features beyond basic HTML.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)
- UI should be minimal and clear, using default styles or basic CSS.
- Layout: Two input fields, operation selector (dropdown or buttons), result display, and error message area.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)
- Should use the existing frontend and backend structure as a reference for setup.
- All logic can be implemented client-side; no backend integration required for this demo.

## 8. Success Metrics
- The calculator performs correct calculations for all four operations.
- Invalid input and division by zero are handled gracefully.
- The app can be run locally using the base app setup.

## 9. Open Questions
- Should the calculator support decimal numbers, or only integers?
- Should there be any UI feedback for successful calculations (e.g., highlight result)?
