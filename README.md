# TaskMaster

Starting with any description of a feature, this project supplies tooling to automate creation of PRD and Task List files, and then Codex agent (or local IDE agent) will manage work from this list, updating it as needed. There are four phases:

## PRD file creation

- Add feature specs and background to `.project-management/current-prd/prd-background/`:
  - `feature-specification.md` containing feature specs with as much or little detail as needed. Mandatory for running PRD creation in Codex. For local IDE agent feature specs can be delivered via copilot.
  - `design-mock.html` Optional design mockup file.
  - `api-documentation.md` Optional documentation for feature techinical assistance.
- Create the PRD:
  - Codex: Start task in _Code_ mode with just the phrase **CreatePrd**
  - _or_
  - Local IDE agent: Give focus to `create-prd.md` file, enter specs (or just 'go' if background has full feature specs).
- There will be Q&A with the Agent, On Codex answer questions and resume in _Code_ mode (Environment is spun up again)
- Result should be a PRD file in `.project-management/current-prd/`
- Merge PR to target branch

## Task list file creation

- Create Task List File:
  - Codex: Start task in _Code_ mode with just the phrase **CreateTasks**
  - _or_
  - Local IDE agent: Give focus to `generate-tasks.md` file and send **go** message
- Q&A, answer and click code
- Result should be a task list file at `.project-management/current-prd/`
- Merge PR to target branch

## TaskMaster

- Once `.project-management/tasks/current-tasks.md` is created, the TaskMaster message can be used. This will allow the agent to commit to one or more tasks in a session. The task list file will be updated as part of the PR, with completed tasks checked off and relevant files updated as needed.
- Start Codex in Code mode using the phrase _TaskMaster_. This will corece the agent to reference `process-tasks-cloud.md' which picks one or more tasks to complete in the session.
- _Alternatively, tasks can be executed by local agent with focus on `process-tasks-local.md' which will run one task at a time_

## Feature Close

- Perform final feature review
  - Codex: Start task in _Code_ mode with just the phrase **ClosePrd**
  - _or_
  - Local IDE agent: Give focus to `close-prd.md` file and send **go** message
- Review will either:
  - Result in flagged changes - review and resubmit the close out
  - Pass review and close the PRD - feature files are moved from `current-prd` to `closed-prd`

## Calendar Event Synchronization Service

TaskMaster includes an advanced Calendar Event Synchronization Service that provides bidirectional synchronization between tasks and Microsoft Outlook calendars.

### Features

- **Bidirectional Sync**: Automatic two-way synchronization between TaskMaster tasks and Microsoft Outlook calendar events
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent handling of conflicts when both task and calendar event are modified
- **Real-time Updates**: Webhook-based notifications for instant sync when calendar events change
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk synchronization for initial setup and periodic maintenance
- **Enterprise Integration**: Full Microsoft Graph API integration with proper authentication and permissions

### API Endpoints

```
POST   /calendar/sync           - Trigger full synchronization for user
GET    /calendar/events         - List synchronized calendar events
POST   /calendar/events/:id/sync - Sync specific calendar event to task
DELETE /calendar/events/:id     - Remove calendar event synchronization
POST   /calendar/webhooks       - Microsoft Graph webhook notifications (internal)
```

### Setup Requirements

1. **Microsoft Graph API Configuration**:
   - Register application in Azure AD
   - Configure API permissions: `Calendars.ReadWrite`, `User.Read`
   - Set up webhook notification URLs

2. **Environment Variables**:

   ```env
   MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id
   MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/microsoft/callback
   ```

3. **Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

### Integration Flow

1. User authenticates with Microsoft account via OAuth2
2. System requests calendar permissions and establishes webhook subscriptions
3. Automatic bidirectional sync maintains consistency between tasks and calendar events
4. Conflict resolution ensures data integrity during simultaneous modifications

## Codex Environment Setup

Go to https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/environments, select or create your github-connected environment then Edit -> Advanced and copy-paste install.sh into the startup script textbox. Save

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a modern full-stack architecture:

### Backend (NestJS)

- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL (SQLite for development)
- **Real-time**: y-websocket server for collaborative document editing
- **APIs**: Microsoft Graph SDK and Google APIs integration
- **Testing**: Jest with NestJS testing utilities

### Frontend (Next.js)

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI component library
- **State**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- **Real-time**: y-websocket client for collaborative features
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library

### Development Workflow

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and update any secrets
2. Run `./dev_init.sh` to start both servers (set `USE_DOCKER=true` to use Docker)
3. Frontend: http://localhost:3000
4. Backend API: http://localhost:8000
5. API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
6. Collaboration WebSocket: ws://localhost:8001/collaboration
7. Install git hooks with `npm install` in the project root

### Database Setup

The project uses Prisma with PostgreSQL in production and SQLite for development:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed  # Optional: seed with sample data
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Run `npm install` in the project root to install Husky. The `pre-commit` hook runs ESLint and Jest tests for both backend and frontend.

### Docker Workflow

For a containerized setup, ensure Docker is installed and running. Start all services using docker-compose with:

```bash
USE_DOCKER=true ./dev_init.sh
```

This command builds the images and launches the database, backend, and frontend containers defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
To stop the containers when finished, run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Apply the manifests in `k8s/` to deploy the application:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/backend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

Expose the `codex-frontend` service with a LoadBalancer or Ingress as needed.

### Authentication

The backend provides a simple JWT-based authentication module.

1. Set `JWT_SECRET` in your `.env` file.
2. Send a POST request to `/auth/login` with `{ "email": "user@example.com" }` to receive an access token.
3. Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when calling protected routes.
