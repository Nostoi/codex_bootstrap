  "details": "## Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation Task - Implementation Progress\n\n**Task Status: Major Progress - 89% Test Success Rate**\n\n### 🎯 ACHIEVEMENTS COMPLETED\n1. **ARIA Grid Structure Fixed**\n   - AccessibleCalendar.tsx now has proper ARIA grid with row hierarchy\n   - Resolved \"aria-required-parent\" violations for calendar gridcells\n   - Calendar header structure implemented with proper navigation labels\n\n2. **Role Conflicts Resolved**\n   - Removed conflicting role=\"status\" from button energy indicators  \n   - Fixed aria-constants.ts to use data attributes instead of roles\n   - Added proper type=\"button\" attributes to prevent form submission\n\n3. **Color Contrast & Visual Design**\n   - Created comprehensive accessibility.css with WCAG 2.2 AA compliant colors\n   - Enhanced globals.css with accessibility-focused design tokens\n   - Implemented high contrast mode and reduced motion support\n   - Added proper focus indicators with 3px outlines and 2px offset\n\n4. **Landmark Structure Implementation**\n   - Added proper semantic landmarks to layout.tsx (nav, main, footer)\n   - Implemented skip links for keyboard navigation\n   - Enhanced navigation with aria-labels and proper hierarchy\n\n5. **Component Architecture**\n   - Fixed CalendarHeader.tsx syntax errors and ARIA implementation\n   - Enhanced accessibility testing utilities\n   - Integrated screen reader announcements and live regions\n\n### 📊 TEST RESULTS ANALYSIS\n- **Total Tests**: 56 accessibility tests\n- **Passing**: 50 tests (89% success rate)\n- **Failing**: 6 tests requiring final fixes\n\n**Test Breakdown:**\n- Basic accessibility: 2/2 passed ✅\n- Main accessibility suite: 36/42 passed (85.7%)\n- General accessibility: 12/12 passed ✅\n- Calendar accessibility: Fixed build errors ✅\n\n### 🔧 REMAINING ISSUES (6 failures to address)\n1. **Keyboard Navigation Focus Management**\n   - KeyboardNavigationContainer tests failing on focus transitions\n   - Arrow key navigation not properly updating focus state\n   - Need to fix keyboard event handling in navigation components\n\n2. **Color Contrast in Test Environment**\n   - 12 color contrast violations (1.00:1 ratio) appearing in tests\n   - Likely CSS not loading properly in test environment\n   - Need to ensure test setup includes accessibility.css\n\n3. **Calendar Event Display**\n   - Event rendering functionality incomplete\n   - Energy level indicators not properly integrated\n   - Missing event display in calendar day cells\n\n4. **Test Query Specificity**\n   - Integration test failing due to multiple button elements\n   - Need more specific selectors in test cases\n   - Landmark detection issues in test scenarios\n\n### 🎯 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\n\n**WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance Features:**\n- Minimum 4.5:1 color contrast ratios\n- 44px minimum touch targets on mobile\n- Focus indicators with 3px solid outlines\n- Proper heading hierarchy and landmark structure\n- Screen reader compatible announcements\n- Keyboard navigation with clear focus management\n- Reduced motion support for vestibular disorders\n\n**ADHD-Optimized Patterns:**\n- Energy level indicators with data attributes\n- Cognitive load management features\n- Motion-reduced animations preference support\n- Clear visual feedback and progress indicators\n\n### 📋 FINAL IMPLEMENTATION STEPS\n1. Fix keyboard navigation focus management in KeyboardNavigationContainer\n2. Resolve color contrast loading in test environment\n3. Complete calendar event display functionality\n4. Enhance test specificity for integration scenarios\n5. Validate comprehensive WCAG compliance\n\n**Confidence Level**: High - Core accessibility infrastructure complete with 89% test success rate. Remaining issues are specific fixes rather than architectural changes.",
