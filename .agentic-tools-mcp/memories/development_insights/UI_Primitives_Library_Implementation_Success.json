  "title": "UI Primitives Library Implementation Success",
  "details": "Successfully implemented UI Primitives Library with 6 core components following ADHD-friendly design patterns and WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards.\n\nKey Implementation Details:\n• Badge Component: Multi-variant system (energy, status, confidence, priority) with semantic colors and proper ARIA labels. Fixed array children handling for proper accessibility.\n• Button Component: Complete button system with loading states, icons, energy theming, and ButtonGroup for related actions.\n• Modal Component: Accessible modal with focus trapping, escape key handling, backdrop dismissal, and scroll lock management.\n• Toast Component: Context-based notification system with auto-dismiss, animations, and non-intrusive positioning. Removed invalid convenience functions that violated rules of hooks.\n• Skeleton Component: Multiple loading placeholder variants including specialized layouts for cards, tables, and dashboard elements.\n• ErrorBoundary Component: Class-based error boundary with graceful fallbacks, recovery mechanisms, and specialized error types.\n\nTechnical Challenges Solved:\n1. JSX children arrays: When React parses template literals like `{level.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + level.slice(1)} Energy`, it creates arrays of text nodes. Fixed by handling Array.isArray(children) in accessibility label generation.\n2. Hooks violations: Toast convenience functions called useToast() outside components. Removed and kept only useToastActions() hook.\n3. Path mapping: Ensured all imports use @/ alias for consistency with tsconfig paths.\n4. Dependencies: Added clsx (2.1.1) and tailwind-merge (3.2.1) for proper class name handling.\n\nFiles Created:\n• Components: Badge.tsx, Button.tsx, Modal.tsx, Toast.tsx, Skeleton.tsx, ErrorBoundary.tsx\n• Utils: Enhanced utils.ts with cn(), trapFocus(), debounce(), formatDuration()\n• Tests: Comprehensive test coverage for all components with accessibility testing\n• Stories: Storybook documentation for all components\n• Index: Barrel export for clean imports\n\nADHD Design Features:\n• Energy level indicators with high-contrast colors\n• Predictable interaction patterns\n• Clear loading states and transitions\n• Non-disruptive notifications\n• Consistent spacing and typography\n• Reduced cognitive load through semantic organization\n\nAccessibility Compliance:\n• WCAG 2.2 AA color contrast ratios\n• Keyboard navigation support\n• Focus management and visible focus indicators\n• Screen reader compatible ARIA labels\n• Semantic HTML structure\n• High contrast mode compatibility\n\nPerformance Optimizations:\n• React.memo and useCallback where appropriate\n• Efficient class name composition with tailwind-merge\n• Lazy loading patterns for complex components\n• Optimized re-render patterns",
