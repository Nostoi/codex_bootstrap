  "details": "**Advanced Calendar Drag-and-Drop Scheduling - Current State Analysis**\n\n## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS âœ…\nThe drag-and-drop infrastructure is largely complete! Key findings:\n\n### FULLY IMPLEMENTED COMPONENTS:\n1. **@dnd-kit Setup**: All required packages installed (@dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable, @dnd-kit/modifiers, @dnd-kit/utilities)\n\n2. **DragWrapper Component** (280 lines): \n   - Comprehensive DndContext with ADHD-friendly settings\n   - 300ms drag delay to prevent accidental operations\n   - Keyboard accessibility (Arrow keys, Enter/Space, Escape)\n   - Visual drag overlay with reduced motion support\n   - Proper sensor setup (PointerSensor, KeyboardSensor)\n\n3. **CalendarEvent Component**: \n   - useDraggable hook implemented\n   - Energy level styling and metadata display\n   - Proper drag data structure\n\n4. **TimeSlot Component** (330 lines):\n   - useDroppable hook implemented\n   - Conflict detection and visual feedback\n   - Event stacking support\n\n5. **DailyGrid Component** (250 lines):\n   - Full integration with DragWrapper\n   - useDragAndDrop hook implementation\n   - 24-hour time slot generation (30-minute intervals)\n\n6. **useDragAndDrop Hook** (276 lines):\n   - Comprehensive drag state management\n   - Conflict detection logic  \n   - ADHD-specific drag behaviors\n   - Event and task scheduling support\n\n### MISSING COMPONENTS (IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED):\n1. **WeeklyGrid.tsx** - Referenced but not implemented\n2. **MonthlyGrid.tsx** - Referenced but not implemented\n3. **Drag-and-drop integration in weekly/monthly views**\n\n### ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS:\n- DragWrapper provides DndContext at high level\n- Individual CalendarEvent components are draggable\n- TimeSlot components are droppable zones\n- Comprehensive ADHD considerations (reduced motion, drag delays, visual feedback)\n- Full accessibility compliance with keyboard navigation\n\n### NEXT IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:\n1. Create WeeklyGrid.tsx with drag-and-drop support\n2. Create MonthlyGrid.tsx with drag-and-drop support  \n3. Test drag-and-drop across all three view types\n4. Verify accessibility compliance\n5. Add confirmation dialogs for significant schedule changes\n\nThe hard work is done - just need to complete the missing grid components!",
