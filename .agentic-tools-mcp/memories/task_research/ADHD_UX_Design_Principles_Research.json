  "details": "## ADHD-Friendly UX Design Principles for Design System\n\n### Core Cognitive Accessibility Principles:\n\n1. **Reduce Cognitive Load**\n   - Avoid overwhelming users with complex interfaces\n   - Split tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Present information in bite-sized chunks\n   - Limit interactive elements per page - show only what's relevant\n\n2. **Support Focus and Attention**\n   - Minimize distractions (pop-ups, moving animations, autoplay videos)\n   - Use high-salience wayfinding with color-coding\n   - Provide just-in-time recaps after dense sections\n   - Use motion only to reaffirm progress (subtle slide-in tick, no looping)\n\n3. **Consistent and Predictable Navigation**\n   - Use standard UI patterns users understand intuitively\n   - Create clear visual hierarchy with size, color, positioning\n   - Descriptive links/buttons (\"Learn more about services\" vs \"Click here\")\n   - Predictable navigation and layout patterns\n\n4. **ADHD-Specific Workflow Optimizations**\n   - High-contrast wayfinding with color-coded sections\n   - Progress indicators for energy planning\n   - Just-in-time recaps and reset clips\n   - Avoid autoplay and provide motion controls\n\n### Key Implementation Guidelines:\n\n1. **Typography**: 1.5x line-height, generous paragraph spacing\n2. **Motion Control**: CSS transitions with prefers-reduced-motion support\n3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear contrast ratios, consistent spacing patterns\n4. **Energy Level Indicators**: Red (high), Yellow (medium), Green (low)\n\n### Neurodesign Considerations:\n- Cognitive fluency boosts retention by 35%\n- Visual hierarchy directs attention effectively\n- Emotional triggers through colors and microcopy\n- Interfaces that \"just feel right\" through natural expectations\n\n### 2025 Trends:\n- Neuro-inclusive UX becoming standard\n- Cleaner layouts with fewer distractions\n- Optional motion settings for sensory overload\n- Content density toggles (simplified vs detailed view)\n- Predictable navigation patterns for comfort",
