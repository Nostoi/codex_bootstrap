# TaskCard & ChatGPTIntegration Implementation Plan

Based on the Helmsman feature specification, here's the complete implementation roadmap:

## ✅ Phase 1: COMPLETED - Dashboard Integration
- Replaced simple TaskList with AI-powered Dashboard component
- ChatGPT integration now available in dashboard
- FocusView provides intelligent task prioritization
- TaskCard displays tasks with metadata

## 🔄 Phase 2: Enhanced TaskCard Features

### Required TaskCard Enhancements:
```typescript
interface EnhancedTaskCard {
  // Core fields (already supported)
  id: string
  title: string
  status: 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'done' | 'blocked'
  
  // Spec-required metadata to add:
  estimated_time?: number        // minutes - show as time badges
  energy_level?: 'low' | 'med' | 'high'  // color-coded energy indicators
  focus_type?: 'creative' | 'admin' | 'social'  // icon-based focus types
  soft_deadline?: string         // flexible deadline
  hard_deadline?: string         // critical deadline with urgency
  source?: 'self' | 'boss' | 'team'  // assignment source badges
  priority: number               // 1-5 priority with visual hierarchy
  project?: string               // project grouping
  dependencies?: string[]        // blocked task indicators
  aiSuggestion?: string         // AI-generated recommendations
}
```

### Visual Enhancements Needed:
- 🎯 Priority indicators (1-5 with color coding)
- ⚡ Energy level badges (Green=low, Yellow=med, Red=high)  
- 🧠 Focus type icons (🎨=creative, 📋=admin, 👥=social)
- ⏱️ Time estimates with visual duration bars
- 🚧 Dependency/blocked status indicators
- 📅 Deadline urgency with color coding
- 💡 AI suggestion tooltips

## 🤖 Phase 3: ChatGPT Integration Features

### Must-Have AI Features (per spec):
1. **Task Extraction**: Parse emails/notes → structured tasks
2. **Project Summarization**: Analyze project status and suggest next steps  
3. **Task Classification**: Auto-assign energy/focus/time estimates
4. **Proactive Suggestions**: Recommend follow-ups based on patterns

### Backend API Integration:
```typescript
// Required API endpoints to connect:
POST /api/ai/extract-tasks      // Extract tasks from text
POST /api/ai/classify-task      // Auto-classify task metadata
POST /api/ai/summarize-project  // Project analysis
GET  /api/ai/suggestions        // Proactive recommendations
POST /api/ai/chat               // General AI chat
```

## 📊 Phase 4: Daily/Weekly Focus Algorithm

### "Today's Plan" Generation (Core Spec Requirement):
- Consider user energy patterns
- Respect estimated task durations
- Prioritize by deadlines and dependencies  
- Balance focus types throughout the day
- Show blocked vs. ready tasks clearly

### Algorithm Components:
1. **Energy Mapping**: Match high-energy tasks to peak hours
2. **Time Blocking**: Fit tasks into available time slots
3. **Dependency Resolution**: Prioritize unblocking tasks
4. **Focus Batching**: Group similar focus types together

## 🧠 Phase 5: Semantic Memory (Mem0) Integration

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
- Query across tasks, notes, emails for context
- Remember user preferences and patterns
- Provide contextually-aware suggestions
- Learn from completed tasks to improve estimates

## 🔧 Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Week 1):
1. ✅ Dashboard integration (DONE)
2. Enhance TaskCard with energy/focus/priority displays
3. Connect ChatGPT to backend AI endpoints

### Short-term (Week 2-3):
1. Implement "Today's Plan" algorithm  
2. Add task extraction from text input
3. Auto-classification of task metadata

### Medium-term (Month 1):
1. Project summarization and insights
2. Proactive suggestion engine
3. Dependency tracking and blocking indicators

### Long-term (Month 2+):
1. Mem0 semantic memory integration
2. Advanced RAG capabilities  
3. Learning algorithms for personalization

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Functional Validation:
- [ ] All spec "Must Have" features implemented
- [ ] TaskCard displays all required metadata
- [ ] ChatGPT extracts tasks from unstructured text
- [ ] "Today's Plan" generates intelligent daily schedules

### User Experience:
- [ ] Cognitive load reduction (subjective survey)
- [ ] Task completion rate improvement
- [ ] User engagement with AI features
- [ ] Time-to-productivity for new tasks

## 🚀 Next Actions

1. **Enhance TaskCard UI** with energy/focus/priority indicators
2. **Connect ChatGPT** to backend AI endpoints  
3. **Implement task extraction** workflow
4. **Build "Today's Plan"** scheduling algorithm
5. **Add project summarization** features

The foundation is now in place - the sophisticated components exist and are integrated. Now it's about enhancing them to match the full Helmsman specification!
